# gait-emotion-recognition
Gait-Emotion Recognition is an AI-driven technique to infer a person's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry) solely from their unique walking style. By analyzing kinematic cues like speed, stride length, and body posture, it offers a remote, non-intrusive method for human behavior analysis in robotics, security, and healthcare applications.
